Welcome to mdxplain
===================

A Python toolkit for scalable molecular dynamics trajectory analysis, combining modular workflows,
memory-efficient processing and interpretable machine learning via decision trees to identify key
conformational features and streamline complex pipelines.

mdxplain is designed for **interpretable molecular dynamics trajectory analysis**, bridging the
gap between raw simulation data and biological insights. It excels when you need to move from
thousands of MD frames to actionable, explainable results while maintaining complete workflow
reproducibility.

Core Strengths
--------------

- **Automated conformational analysis** with interpretable feature importance
- **Memory-efficient processing** for trajectories exceeding available RAM
- **Multi-trajectory comparison workflows** with tag-based organization
- **Complete pipeline persistence** for reproducible science
- **Decision tree explainability** for understanding state-defining features
