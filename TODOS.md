# TODOs before Version 1.0
## Must Have
- We need the visualization module and the analysis module => For this we also need requirements

- We need unit tests, example notebooks and documentation

- Cleanup

## Maybes
- Features should get more features: CCI (a normalized combination of contacts and distances)
cutoff using vdw radii. Soft Contact with linear and sigmoid cut

- In the nomenclature for consensus, fragments and nomenclature could be guessed with mdciao => This would simplify the use of consensus

- Save of PipelineManager auto

- config

- Errors and prints should work with line breaks

- Logging!

- FeatureImportance should get 1 or 2 more Methods like RandomForest for sure and maybe SVMs
