    "# mdxplain Tutorial: Introduction to Conformational Analysis with mdxplain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are dynamic molecules that sample multiple conformational states during their lifespan. Understanding which conformations exist and what distinguishes them at the molecular level is crucial for comprehending protein mechanisms.\n",
    "The challenge in analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories lies in extracting biologically meaningful conformational states from thousands of simulation frames. Traditional approaches often require manual selection of collective variables or a priori knowledge of relevant structural features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates mdxplain an automated pipeline builder that can be used to identify distinct conformational states and determines the specific residue-residue contacts that characterize each state. The approach combines machine learning techniques with structural biology principles to transform high-dimensional trajectory data into interpretable biological insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline addresses key challenges in conformational analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Convert atomic coordinates to rotation/translation-invariant contact descriptors\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Overcome the curse of dimensionality for clustering in high-dimensional spaces\n",
    "3. **State Identification**: Determine the number and boundaries of conformational states\n",
    "4. **State Characterization**: Identify which molecular interactions distinguish each state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test System\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze the Villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY [1]), a 64-residue protein domain that serves often as a model system for protein folding studies [2-7]. The trajectory contains 9,368 frames (9368 ns) with 1,027 atoms.\n",

    "### Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note on memory mapping (memmap) and chunk sizing\n",
    "- What memmap is: Arrays are kept on disk and only the required slices are loaded into RAM on demand. This keeps the memory footprint low at the cost of extra I/O.\n",
    "- When to enable memmap (use_memmap=True):\n",
    "  - Trajectories that approach/exceed available RAM\n",
    "  - Multiple trajectories opened at once\n",
    "  - Interactive analysis on laptops/workstations with limited memory\n",
    "- When to disable memmap (use_memmap=False):\n",
    "  - Small/medium datasets that comfortably fit in RAM\n",
    "  - You need maximum speed and have ample memory (e.g., HPC node)\n",
    "  - You are on a slow or remote filesystem where frequent random I/O is costly\n",
    "- Choosing chunk_size (number of frames processed per batch):\n",
    "  - Start with 500–2000 as a general rule of thumb; 1000 is a balanced default\n",
    "  - Increase if you have plenty of RAM (fewer I/O operations, faster overall)\n",
    "  - Decrease if you observe high memory usage, swapping, or OOM errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick mental model for memory needs\n",
    "- Per-batch memory = (n_features × bytes_per_feature) × chunk_size_frames + overhead\n",
    "- Examples: contacts often use 1 byte/feature; float32 distances use 4 bytes/feature\n",
    "- Aim for the batch to stay well below ~50% of available RAM to leave room for temporary arrays and the OS\n"

    "\n",
    "The goal of this step is to group the simulation trajectory data into a set of distinct conformational states using a clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary challenge in this analysis is that conventional clustering methods, such as k-means, are problematic for this type of data. Such methods presuppose spherical cluster shapes and require the number of clusters to be known. Neither assumption is appropriate for the complex and unknown nature of conformational landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, we employ a density based clustering in this example the Density Peak Advanced (DPA) algorithm. DPA identifies cluster centers as high-density regions that are separated by low-density boundaries, which allows it to automatically determine the optimal number of states. A Z-score(Z-value) threshold of 2.0 is used to achieve a balance between the sensitivity needed to resolve distinct conformational biases and the robustness required to filter out the thermal noise inherent to molecular dynamics simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our daily analysis of MD data, we find that DPA is not only highly effective but also more straightforward to apply than other density-based methods, such as DBSCAN or HDBSCAN. Its primary advantage lies in its practical approach to hyperparameter tuning. While the DPA algorithm includes several configurable parameters, we have found that in practice, default values are typically sufficient for the clustering of conformational states. The Z-value can the be used to control the desired level of clustering granularity. Higher Z-values produce a coarser clustering with fewer, more distinct states, while lower values yield a more fine-grained result. This provides us with an intuitive mechanism to adjust the clustering resolution, circumventing the need to optimize the more abstract hyperparameters, such as eps and min_samples, required by (H)DBSCAN."

It generates a set of human-readable rules that explain what makes a state unique.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walked through an end‑to‑end, contact‑focused workflow: Feature engineering of residue contacts, dimensionality reduction with Contact Kernel PCA, and clustering with DPA, to identify conformational states and the specific interactions that define them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key strength of mdxplain is its modular pipeline builder: each step can be swapped or extended without changing the overall flow, and all intermediate results are collected and reused via `pipeline.data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the minimal example, mdxplain supports a broader feature set (e.g., DSSP/secondary structure, torsion angles, SASA, distances, raw coordinates) and multiple alternatives for dimensionality reduction and clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "By standardizing data flow and bookkeeping, the library streamlines building and saving analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common applications include:\n",
    "- Exporting feature matrices for downstream machine‑learning models.\n",
    "- Tag‑based comparisons across conditions (e.g., wild type vs mutant, ligand‑bound vs apo) to identify discriminative features (contacts, secondary structure, SASA) and explain structural/dynamical effects.\n",
    "- Estimating state transition counts and preparing inputs for Markov state models.\n",
    "- Computing contact frequencies or other statistical feature properties and their differences across systems.\n",
    "- Doing RMSD and RMSF analysis for basic insights into the systems.\n",
    "- Paralell working on many trajectories at once.\n",
    "- Having many different metrices and features of many different trajectories at one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "And many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend the workflow, `pipeline.analysis.structure` provides multiple RMSD/RMSF metrics, and `pipeline.analysis.feature.*` offers per‑feature statistics (e.g., contact frequencies, transition counts). Combining these with state discovery enables richer, multi‑faceted analyses that connect structure, dynamics, and feature statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of any analysis depends on adequate conformational sampling and the suitability of the chosen descriptors. Hyperparameters such as contact cutoffs, the number of components, and clustering sensitivity may require light tuning across systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there are thousands of different other methods one could use for the analysis. But for this cases, mdxplain serves you with the necessary feature-data in an memory efficient, performant and streamlined way. \n",
    "\n",
    "But with this, there is another limitation. Disk space. If you use your disk for big analysis, cause your trajectory and feature data does not fit in RAM, you need disk space. For hugh system this can also become a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "mdxplain lowers the effort to move from raw trajectories to interpretable, testable insights by simplifying the composition, execution, and persistence of complex structural analysis pipelines. Its modular design and extensibility make it a practical tool across structural biology use cases."
